# Example Express/Prisma/EJS Application

This is a quick example I threw together to demonstrate some
of the relevant technologies, it:

- Connects to a database using Prisma and runs some migrations via the Schema file
- Has an Express-based server with a couple of endpoints
- Has an endpoint to interact with the database and yield some JSON
- Renders views via EJS templates
- Uses TypeScript

Keep in mind I threw this together in all of ten minutes as an example, but it should
at least demonstrate baseline familiarity with the tech mentioned above
